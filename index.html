                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>The Organization is a Charity Based Organization founded by David Mutie in 2020. The need to 
                        show love to the vulnerable through support by purchasing basic needs was the foundation for the establishment.
                        It began with a few members mostly close friends but the number has increased significantly over the years. We have
                        reached out to many people in the society offering support both financially and psychologically.

                    <h2>Carnival of Love Season 1</h2>
                    <p>Our first project conducted in Soweto slum. We reached out to several street families and donated 
                        toiletries, amongst some other household stuff. In association with other CBOs, the event was a success. We 
                        had fun with the kids, as we played some fun games and also there was bonding amongst each member groups and also a 
                        session for motivational talk was held.

                    <h2>Carnival of Love Season 2</h2>
                    <p>Our second charity event held at St. Ann and Joachim parish in Soweto slums. This event
                        was aimed to reach out to the vulnerable families within the slums of the Soweto. The idea was 
                        to support them through providing some foodstuff. Over fifty families were supported through the initative.
                        In conjuction with other CBOs, the event was a success as well.
